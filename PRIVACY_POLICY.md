# Privacy Policy – Julius

**Last updated:** February 2025

Julius ("we", "our", or "the app") is a voice AI assistant for Android and Android Auto. This policy describes how we handle your data.

## 1. Permissions and Data We Access

### 1.1 Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)

- **Purpose:** Voice input for hands-free interaction.
- **When used:** Only when you tap to speak or use voice commands.
- **Processing:** Audio is either processed locally on your device (Embedded agent) or sent to the AI provider you choose (OpenAI, Gemini, Perplexity, ElevenLabs, etc.).
- **Storage:** We do not store or record your voice. Audio is processed in real time and discarded after the response is generated.

### 1.2 Internet (INTERNET)

- **Purpose:** To communicate with AI services when you use cloud-based agents.
- **Note:** The Embedded agent works fully offline and does not use the internet.

### 1.3 Phone and Messaging (CALL_PHONE, SEND_SMS)

- **Purpose:** To perform actions you request (e.g. "call X", "send SMS to Y").
- **Processing:** Used only when you explicitly ask the assistant to make a call or send a message.

### 1.4 Alarms (SET_ALARM)

- **Purpose:** To set alarms or reminders you request via voice.

## 2. Data Collection and Sharing

- **We do not sell your data.**
- **We do not collect personal data** beyond what is needed for the app to function.
- When you use cloud-based agents, your voice and messages are sent to the respective provider (OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, ElevenLabs). Their privacy policies apply to that data.
- API keys you configure are stored locally on your device and are not shared with us.

## 3. Data Storage

- Conversation history and settings are stored locally on your device.
- We do not operate servers that store your voice or conversation data.

## 4. Your Choices

- You can deny microphone permission; the app will not record audio.
- You can choose the Embedded agent for fully offline use.
- You can clear app data at any time via Android settings.
