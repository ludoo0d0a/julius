# Julius - Voice AI Assistant

Julius is a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** application designed to provide a seamless voice assistant experience on **Android** and **Android Auto**.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

- **`:shared`**: Contains the core business logic, data models, and cross-platform code. This module handles the voice processing interactions and state management, shared between different platform entry points.
- **`:androidApp`**: The Android application entry point. This module includes the UI for the mobile application and the integration with Android Auto services.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Leverages advanced voice processing to understand and respond to user commands.
- **Android Auto Support**: Optimized specifically for the car environment, allowing for hands-free operation and safe driving experiences.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Built with KMP to share logic efficiently and ensure consistency across platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Koala or newer (recommended for KMP support).
- JDK 17 or higher.

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle project.
4. Run the `:androidApp` configuration to deploy to a device or emulator.

### Configuration

Create a `local.properties` file in the root directory if it doesn't exist (it is automatically generated by Android Studio) to define your SDK path and any secret API keys required for the voice services.

```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk
```
